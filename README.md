# atomic-generator-react

Renders react components as static html markup. One css file is generated which contains all styles.

First:

    npm install    
Serves the playground (components/playground/playground):

    npm run dev
Builds a static pattern library under dist/atomic (The css file is under dist/assets/css):

    npm run build

Production build:

    npm run build:prod

### Motivation

React with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is fine if you want to build a dynamic web app. With frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) you can build static pages, too.

But I needed a tool which makes it possible to deliver single React components from a CMS as individual building blocks.
